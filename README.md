# testmod
 # testmod  A Minecraft mod I'm making to test things out. Hope to make a more polished mod later down the road. # Disclaimer  I use many mods to help me test things, so anything in the "mods" folder is not mine.  I've also used some sound effects not created by me and credited in the "credits.json" file.
